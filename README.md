## Some tips:

### AutoNext is enabled in Group 1 and all its parts, so the question set automatically skips to the next set after approximately 25 seconds, having highlighted the correct answer in green. 

### If the mouse pointer hovers over the 'Auto Next' label, auto-skipping is paused until the pointer is moved away from the label.

### When a question is skipped with Next question ‚ùå is shown before moving on to the next question or to the end, which indicates that it wasn't answered.
